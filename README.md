# Data-Visualisation
I employed a diverse set of visualisation techniques to unearth valuable insights from the dataset. Histograms were utilized to depict the distribution of numerical data, allowing us to identify patterns, outliers, and central tendencies with clarity. Time series graphs enabled us to track data trends over time, uncovering temporal patterns and seasonality. Additionally, barplots were employed to compare categorical data, providing a visual means to understand differences and relationships among various groups or categories. By harnessing the potential of these visualization methods, we were able to extract actionable insights and facilitate data-driven decision-making with precision.
